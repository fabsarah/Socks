# Socks
This function returns the most appropriate sock choice for temperatures in  Celsius ('C'), Fahrenheit ('F') Kelvin ('K'), and Rankine ('R', YEAH I SEE YOU, ENGINEERS.).  Inputs are the temperature as a scalar (temp), and the scale as a character ('C', 'F', 'K', 'R'...).  If the scale field is empty, temp is assumed to be in Celsius, the best and most logical scale.
